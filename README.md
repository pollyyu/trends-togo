trendstogo plots food trends at a City and Food Topic level. The data was obtained from menu and review data from 30,000 restaurants on grubhub.com. Please check it out on https://trendstogo.herokuapp.com/.

## Description
This project was incepted from a desire to find food trends in the US and an empathy towards restaurants, being difficult entities to succeed. As the demand for food delivery grow exponentially over the past years, so have the size of platforms such as Grubhub, Ubereats and Doordash. But while the market grows, restaurants are not necessarily better off as they [swallow high costs of delivery](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cameronkeng/2018/03/26/why-uber-eats-will-eat-you-into-bankruptcy/#29a1e0f221f6) and lose information on their customers and what customers value.

From public information (Grubhub's website), I was able to obtain data about restaurant, their menu profile and their review over time. 

There are 3 main/ modules parts to this project:

### 1. Clustering Restaurants to 30 Topics / Profiles ###

- [So you Want to Open a Ghost Kitchen](https://www.paulynnyu.com/trendstogo1)

### 1. Finding Market Gaps through Creating a Clone ###
- [Cities Aren't Alike, So Create a Clone](https://www.paulynnyu.com/trendstogo2/)

### 1. Finding Market Gaps through time-seris ### 
- [Being Bullish about ... Bulls?](https://www.paulynnyu.com/trendstogo3/)
